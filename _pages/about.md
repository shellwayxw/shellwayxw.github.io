- I am currently a PhD candidate at [the Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), advised by Prof. [Xiangyu Zhang]([#](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/xyzhang/)). Before that, I obtained my bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science and Technology from Zhejiang University in 2019.

- My research interests are program analysis and software testing.
